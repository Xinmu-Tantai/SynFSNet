# AFSIFormer: Adaptive Frequency-Spatial Interaction Attention Mechanism for Aerial Image Semantic Segmentation

**SynFSNet** is an efficient semantic segmentation network designed specifically for aerial imagery. 
---

## 🔑 Key Features
* ### 🧠 AFSIAttention
   
  Fine-grained interaction between frequency and spatial features via head-specific frequency projection and adaptive weighting.
  
* ### 🌐 AFSIFormer Block

  Progressive learning with boundary-aware directional and local window attention for global-local feature synergy.

* ### 🔄 Block-Level Residual Coupling

  A coupling architecture that continuously extracts and enhances global and local features collaboratively, ensuring stable and efficient information flow throughout the network.

* ### 🧩 BiSEM Module

  The Bidirectional Semantic Enhancement Module (BiSEM) efficiently bridges the semantic gap between low-level and high-level features, significantly improving the perception of fine-grained details.

* ### ⚡ Lightweight & Efficient

  Strikes an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy, inference speed, and model generalization, making it ideal for real-world aerial imagery applications.
