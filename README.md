# AFSIFormer: Adaptive Frequency-Spatial Interactive Attention Mechanism for Aerial Image Semantic Segmentation

SynFSNet is an efficient semantic segmentation network designed for aerial imagery. It addresses the limitations of existing methods in exploiting global contextual and frequency domain information. SynFSNet integrates a novel **AFSIFormer Block**, **Block-Level Residual Coupling architecture**, and the **BiSEM module**, enabling progressive feature learning from global to local, while effectively bridging the semantic gap between low-level and high-level features.

## Key Features

* **AFSIFormer Block**: Progressive learning strategy combining frequency-spatial interaction with boundary-aware directional attention.
* **Block-Level Residual Coupling**: Ensures continuous extraction and collaborative enhancement of global and local features.
* **BiSEM Module**: Efficiently bridges the semantic gap between low-level and high-level features, enhancing fine-grained detail perception.
* **Lightweight and Efficient**: Achieves a balance between segmentation accuracy, inference efficiency, and generalization.

## Status

The PyTorch implementation is currently being organized and will be released soon. Stay tuned!
