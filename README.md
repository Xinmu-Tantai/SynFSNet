# AFSIFormer: Adaptive Frequency-Spatial Interactive Attention Mechanism for Aerial Image Semantic Segmentation

**SynFSNet** is an efficient semantic segmentation network designed specifically for aerial imagery. 
---

## 🔑 Key Features

* ### 🌐 AFSIFormer Block

  A novel progressive learning block that fuses frequency-spatial interaction with boundary-aware directional attention, enabling richer and more robust feature extraction.

* ### 🔄 Block-Level Residual Coupling

  A coupling architecture that continuously extracts and enhances global and local features collaboratively, ensuring stable and efficient information flow throughout the network.

* ### 🧩 BiSEM Module

  The Bidirectional Semantic Enhancement Module (BiSEM) efficiently bridges the semantic gap between low-level and high-level features, significantly improving the perception of fine-grained details.

* ### ⚡ Lightweight & Efficient

  Strikes an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy, inference speed, and model generalization, making it ideal for real-world aerial imagery applications.
